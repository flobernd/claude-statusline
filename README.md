A cross-platform statusline for the [Claude Code](https://code.claude.com) CLI: context usage,
token and prompt-cache metrics, model and effort level on the first line; working directory,
git status, and pull request context on the second.

## Features

- Two fixed lines: context bar, absolute context tokens, token counts, prompt-cache hit ratio,
  cache age, model, and effort level on top; working directory, git branch with repo name,
  working tree file counts, stash, sync, operation state, worktree indicators, and the open
  pull request below
- 24-bit truecolor rendering, identical in every terminal regardless of its palette;
  `NO_COLOR` respected
- Chips hide themselves when their data is absent: a clean repo shows a short line, a merge
  conflict or a cold prompt cache stands out
- Clickable branch and pull request chips (OSC 8 hyperlinks, on by default)
- Width-aware: adapts to the terminal width reported by Claude Code, dropping the least
  important chips first
- Single native binary; renders in a few milliseconds with no caches or background processes

## Requirements

- Claude Code 2.1.153 or newer
- `git` on PATH for the repository chips
- A Rust toolchain to build (no runtime dependencies)

## Installation

```bash
cargo build --release
./target/release/claude-statusline --setup
```

The wizard shows a preview and writes the `statusLine` entry (with a `refreshInterval` of 10
seconds, which keeps the cache-age chip live) into `~/.claude/settings.json`, backing up the
previous configuration. Restart Claude Code afterwards. For a non-interactive install use
`--install`; check the result with `--print-config`.

## Configuration

Optional file `~/.claude/claude-statusline.json`:

```json
{
  "clickable_links": true,
  "disabled_sections": ["cache_age"]
}
```

`clickable_links` toggles the OSC 8 hyperlinks. `disabled_sections` hides chips by name:
`context_tokens`, `cache`, `cache_age`, `model`, `effort`, `cwd`, `branch`, `git_files`,
`git_stash`, `git_sync`, `git_state`, `git_worktree`, `pr`, `worktree`.

## Uninstall

```bash
claude-statusline --uninstall
```

This removes the `statusLine` entry and restores the previous configuration when a backup
exists.
